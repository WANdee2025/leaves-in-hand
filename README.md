# 🌿 Leaves in the Hand (สีสปาสูตร)
**"Simsapa Sutta: Direct Knowledge for the Cessation of Suffering"**

A minimalistic digital representation of the **Simsapa Sutta**, focusing on the essential core of Early Buddhist teachings.

## 🍃 Concept: Preservation without Clinging
In the **Simsapa Sutta**, the Buddha compared the vast knowledge he possessed to the leaves in a forest, while the knowledge necessary for liberation was compared to just a few leaves in his hand.

This project aims to:
- **Preserve the Rigor:** Every word and sequence is strictly based on the Pali Canon (Buddhavacana).
- **Enhance Accessibility:** By removing complex scripts and focusing on clear, modern English, we allow the core message to be accessible to the modern-day audience without the "burden" of language barriers.
- **Artisan Aesthetics:** A calm, dark-themed, and minimal visualization designed for contemplation.

## ✨ The Handful of Leaves
The visualization focuses on the **Four Noble Truths**, which are the only "leaves" we need to hold onto for the end of suffering:
1. **Suffering Exists** (Dukkha)
2. **The Cause is Clinging** (Samudaya)
3. **The Total Extinction** (Nirodha)
4. **The Middle Way** (Magga)
